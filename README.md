# bcrs-shared-components

[![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Stable-97ca00)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

This library is based on https://github.com/bcgov/entity/blob/master/rfcs/rfc-shared-components.md.

The Storybook (sample) pages for this library are at https://bcgov.github.io/bcrs-shared-components/.

# Workflow

**\*\*\* NOTE: USE NODE VERSION 20 FOR THE STEPS BELOW \*\*\***

### 1. Clone this repo to your workstation

```
git clone git@github.com:bcgov/bcrs-shared-components.git
cd bcrs-shared-components
```

### 2. If needed, update your local source code

```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main
```
Warning: this overwrites any uncommitted changes on your branch! Stash first if needed.

### 3. Create a local feature branch

```
git co -b my-feature-branch
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```
npm i                         // if new repo
npm i --global lerna@^5.6.2   // if you didn't do this previously
```

**NOTE: Step 5 to 9 are only for adding new component**

### 5. Create your component in its own folder (eg, `src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.vue`)

### 6. Create `package.json file` for your component with version "0.0.0" (see others as examples)

### 7. Update Lerna dependencies

```
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

This updates the node_modules/ in the sub-folders.

### 8. Create new Storybook file for your component (see others as examples)

### 9. Create unit test file for your component and verify locally

```
npm run test:unit MyComponent
```

### 10. Build Storybook and verify your component

```
npm run build-storybook
npm run storybook
```

**NOTE: rebuilding Storybook will delete file `.nojekyll`. Do not commit this change, ie, restore this file.**

Storybook should open in your browser (and will auto-rebuild on code changes).

Note: GitHub Pages are used to serve the Storybook app folder. As this requires a developer to
build before committing, they should ensure that they are building the latest code (ie,
including all other recent changes in the repo).

### 11. Commit your changes to main repo

```
git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch
```

### 12. Create a PR from your branch to "main" in GitHub

### 13. After reviews/fixes, merge your PR

### 14. Update your main branch and have Lerna update the versions of the affected components

```
git co main
git fetch origin
git rebase
lerna version --include-merged-tags
```

Note: This step will create new tags and commit them!

### 15. Publish to npm

```
lerna publish from-package
```

Note: For this step, you need to be logged in to NPM (along with permissions on this library)... follow the prompts if applicable.

### 16. You can now import your new component into a Vue project!

# Special Procedures

## How to Create a New Package You Depend on (eg, new "mixins" folder)

If you want, you can create a new shared package for supporting code (eg, "mixins"). Or,
you can just create a local copy of the files that you need (eg, with only the content that
you need) that your shared component will use when running in Storybook. When your component
is running in your actual app, it would use the app's copy of those files.

To create a new package:
1. create the new package folder (eg, "./src/mixins")
2. add the code files
3. add a package.json file with version = "0.0.0" (see others as examples)
4. add the package name to the "packages" array in lerna.json
5. commit the changes
6. run `lerna version --include-merged-tags` to version your package to "1.0.0"
7. run `lerna publish from-package` to publish your package to npm
